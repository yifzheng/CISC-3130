	 * ## Problem Description

		A local Radio DJ wants to create a sorted playlist based on the song title name. He is in a coding class learning about data structures and tries to 
		create the playlist using a binary search tree.
		
		Part 1 - Storing Data
		
		Store the song titles a binary search tree using the song title as the key used for sorting comparisons. 
		Store the artist and average number of plays for that song, and average number of plays for that artists across the time period of your analysis. 
		A `Song` node is provided as an example for you here, however implementation details are up to you. Choose what makes sense to you.
		
		
		Part 2 - Report
		
		Use the `subSet()` function to help filter the list so that you can save the output to a text file. 
		
		
		```java
		Set sample1 = myPlayList.subSet("Jingle Bells", "Merry Christmas");
		```

Steps to clone repository
  1) in command prompt cd to your directory
  2) from the repository copy the link to the repository you want to clone
  3) in command prompt in chosen directory input git clone "url"
  4) also git init your user.email and user.name for the directory
  5) make any file into the cloned repositry and push the folders/file into github through
    i) git init
    ii) git add . or git add "file name"
    iii) git commit -m "first commit"
    iv) git push
By cloning the directory, I believe that the git commands could be simpler
